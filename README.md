# Overview
poreception is aimed at helping researchers filter their nanopore data.

poreception is compatible only with python3. Run poreception with the following command line argument
```
$ python poreception.py
```

The startup window will prompt you for two files for data sets, one containing summary data, the other containing raw data.

poreception will run slowly with large data sets, but it's purpose is to help researchers filter these datasets down to smaller groups. As the data sets are filtered to be smaller, it should run more quickly.

Please submit any issues you find (I expect many) and see TODO.md for things currently being worked on.
