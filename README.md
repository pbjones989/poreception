# Overview
poreception is aimed at helping researchers filter their nanopore data.

poreception is compatible only with python3. It takes two command line arguments as inputs, the first being a .pkl summary statistics and the second being a .npy file with the raw data that was used to generate the summary statistics
```
$ python poreception.py summary.pkl raw_data.npy
```

Please submit any issues you find (I expect many) and see TODO.md for things currently being worked on.
