# TODO
poreception is very much a work in progress and I have been learning a lot of tkinter and pandas stuff as I create it (most of it probably bad). Please submit issues/suggestions and have some patience with me!

### Features



### Code
* Change UI layout to use grid instead of pack

	* factor more tasks into private methods
